    Decarbonizing Cloud Computing: Opportunities and Tradeoffs
  image: /img/keynotes/shenoy.jpg
  anchor: keynote3
  abstract: |
    The exponential growth of cloud computing has been a defining trend of our time, fueled by rapidly growing demands from data-intensive and machine learning workloads. Despite the end of Denard scaling, the cloud's energy demand grew more slowly than expected over the past decade due to the aggressive implementation of energy-efficiency optimizations. Unfortunately, there are few significant remaining optimization opportunities using traditional methods, and moving forward, the cloud's and AI's continued exponential growth will translate into rising energy demand, which, if left unchecked, will translate to an increasing carbon footprint.<br>
    
    In this talk, I will discuss recent developments in decarbonizing cloud platforms and workloads. I will discuss how AI workloads have contributed to the rising demand for cloud computing and the promise that AI holds for enhancing the sustainability of cloud platforms. I will discuss how recently proposed approaches for designing carbon-efficient systems introduce new tradeoffs in performance, cost, and energy-efficiency when reducing the carbon footprint of modern cloud applications. I will present approaches for navigating these tradeoffs and end with open research challenges in the emerging field of computational decarbonization.

#   image: /img/keynotes/pawel.webp
#   anchor: keynote2
#   abstract: "Single-machine data stores cannot support the scale and ubiquity of data today. The Internet applications and services must process a huge number of concurrent requests and events per second. So, they use distributed (or replicated) data stores which store and process data on multiple machines, offering key advantages in performance, scalability, and reliability. The purpose of the talk is to present a selective and biased choice of techniques and results which can be used for building an efficient distributed data store. Biased, because I only present solutions and results developed within a research project that I did with my PhD students. Selective, because an exhaustive description would be too exhausting to fit into a single talk. Therefore I will be discussing in detail just the design of our novel database index for key-value data store systems, and only skim our other contributions that are directly related to distributed systems. The index, called Jiffy, has been designed with performance and scalability in mind. Therefore it has been designed as a lock-free concurrent data structure, which can dynamically adapt to the changing workload. It achieves superior performance despite built-in atomic operations (batch updates, snapshots, and range scans). During the talk I will be presenting Jiffy's architecture, the algorithms for inserting and looking up the key-value pairs, and the operations used for resizing the data structure dynamically. The other contributions of our project include: efficient support for replica state recovery after failures, either by extending the classic Paxos consensus algorithm, or through the use of persistent memory, and some surprising theoretical results which are applicable to distributed data store systems that compromise consistency in favour of high availability and speed, but also support operations ensuring strong consistency (which requires consensus among replicas)."

#   anchor: keynote1
#   abstract: "Modern data-driven applications arising in such domains as smart manufacturing, healthcare, and the Internet of Things, pose new challenges to data processing systems. Traditional stream processing systems, such as Flink, Spark, or Kafka Streams are ill-suited to cope with the massive scale of distribution, the heterogeneous computing landscape, and the requirement for timely processing and actuation. Classical approaches like managed runtimes, interpretation-based query processing, and the optimization of single queries that neglect interactions, greatly limit throughput, latency, energy-efficiency, and the general usability of these systems for emerging applications involving distributed data processing at scale in a sensor-edge-cloud-environment. At BIFOLD / TU Berlin, we are researching and building NebulaStream, a novel data-stream processing system for massively distributed, heterogeneous environments. NebulaStream supports (potentially resource-constrained) heterogeneous devices, a hierarchical topology (with the distribution of computation and data flow in a cloud-edge-continuum), and the sharing of computations and data across multiple concurrent queries.  The key distinguishing features of NebulaStream from a technological perspective, include the following. (1)	An incremental and continuous query optimizer that considers the sharing of computation and intermediate results in conjunction with the placement of operations in a massively distributed, heterogeneous cloud-edge continuum. (2)	A compilation-based approach for streaming queries, which avoids the need for managed runtimes and ensures excellent throughput, latency, and energy-efficiency across the board, from small embedded devices to powerful processors. (3)	A distributed runtime that supports on-demand in-network processing on a hierarchical topology of heterogeneous devices in an efficient and fault-tolerant way. In this talk, we will describe several challenges arising due to novel applications and architectures for distributed data stream processing. We will present NebulaStream, an innovative open-source system, currently being built to address these challenges. In addition, we will describe NebulaStream’s design principles, architecture, performance, application scenarios, as well as the current status of the open-source development."

Now five years later, I’m happy to have the opportunity to return and talk about the investments we’ve made on those problems at Snowflake in the years since. Using those seven open problems as a framework (Graceful Evolution, Operational Ease of Use, SQL, Formal Semantics, Latency ↔ Cost ↔ Correctness, Batch + Streaming Interoperability, Database-style optimizations), I’ll discuss the areas where we’ve made good progress, both at Snowflake and across the industry as a whole, as well as the areas where a substantial amount of work remains.
# Much of the talk will center around Dynamic Tables, Snowflake’s declarative batch+streaming transformation primitive that is the centerpiece of our streaming offerings. Designed to hide the complexity of stream processing under the simple but powerful interface of a SQL query and a target lag, Dynamic Tables deliver the promise of truly unified batch and stream processing in an easy to use, accessible, and operationally hands off packaging. A truly remarkable feat of engineering, I’ll show how Dynamic Tables have helped move the needle for each of the seven open problems from my 2019 talk.
# In addition, I will touch upon other pieces of the Snowflake streaming portfolio, such as our streaming ingestion service, Snowpipe Streaming; talk briefly about our time spent collaborating on the noble experiment that was the ill-fated SQL Standards Expert Group on Streaming; and give a glimpse of some of the more forward looking efforts we’re actively working on now. By the end, I hope to convey the optimism we at Snowflake all feel regarding the progress made, and the opportunities remaining, in this fascinating field of streaming data."

#   anchor: keynote5
#   abstract: Roblox Metaverse supports an impressive 55M daily users. The underlying infrastructure is geographically distributed, with multiple edge data centers in all continents. The Metaverse stack consists of multiple layers of software systems, with complex dependencies that can be represented as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or a multi-layered queueing system. In short, the concept of Metastability happens when each moving part of the stack works in harmony. In contrast, a Metastable failure results from a trigger originating in some part of the stack that cascades through multiple dependencies to finally affect a third-party system. Such kind of failure has large-scale consequences and can deem the overall stack unusable. The present talk will deep-dive in the characterization (or absence) of metastability based on a queueing theory model and analyze the dynamics that can lead to different flavors of system-wide failures. Furthermore, the model will be used as the basis to (mathematically) devise measures for the early detection of failures and explore fault-tolerance measures that ensure metastability.

#   abstract: "The continuously increasing availability of cloud and edge data center resources is driving our evolution to a data-driven society. Meanwhile, however, the innate sharing of third-party data center resources by users continues to fuel strong security concerns around data and computations handled in and across such infrastructures. While many basic solutions to enforce security have been proposed over the years, both in terms of software mechanisms (cryptographic primitives) and hardware mechanisms (trusted execution environments), they all come with their respective pros and cons. In this talk I will report and reflect on almost a decade of experience of working on the problem of confidentiality-preserving data and event processing. I will cover challenges in terms of guarantees, performance, transparency, or portability and interoperability, discuss tradeoffs therein, solutions, and, finally, open challenges."
#   biography: Patrick is professor of computer science at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland, where he leads the Software Systems (SWYSTEMS) research group. Prior to that Patrick was a regular faculty member at Purdue University (2005–2016) and TU Darmstadt (2014–2017), and a visiting professor at MIT (2012–2013). His research has been awarded by several public funding agencies (e.g., NSF, ERC, DARPA, SNSF) as well as corporate partners (e.g., Cisco, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Meta, NetApp, Northrop-Grumman, SAP) through respective programs. Patrick is interested in all aspects of dependable distributed systems, in particular the intersection with programming languages and networks. Patrick served as PC chair for ACM OOPSLA'15, returning as associate PC chair for ACM OOPSLA'23, and currently serves as associate editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering. But before all that, Patrick started his academic path as an early contributor to event-based systems and DEBS, serving also as PC co-chair for DEBS'12, so he is particularly excited to return.
