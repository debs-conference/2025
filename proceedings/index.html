                                            today. The Internet
                                            applications and services must process a huge number of concurrent requests
                                            and events per
                                            second. So, they use distributed (or replicated) data stores which store and
                                            process data on
                                            multiple machines, offering key advantages in performance, scalability, and
                                            reliability.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of the talk is to present a selective and biased choice of
                                            techniques and results
                                            which can be used for building an efficient distributed data store. Biased,
                                            because I only
                                            present solutions and results developed within a research project that I did
                                            with my PhD
                                            students. Selective, because an exhaustive description would be too
                                            exhausting to fit into a
                                            single talk. Therefore I will be discussing in detail just the design of our
                                            novel database
                                            index for key-value data store systems, and only skim our other
                                            contributions that are directly
                                            related to distributed systems.</p>
                                        <p>The index, called Jiffy, has been designed with performance and scalability
                                            in mind. Therefore it
                                            has been designed as a lock-free concurrent data structure, which can
                                            dynamically adapt to the
                                            changing workload. It achieves superior performance despite built-in atomic
                                            operations (batch
                                            updates, snapshots, and range scans). During the talk I will be presenting
                                            Jiffy's architecture,
                                            the algorithms for inserting and looking up the key-value pairs, and the
                                            operations used for
                                            resizing the data structure dynamically.</p>

                                            state recovery
                                            after failures, either by extending the classic Paxos consensus algorithm,
                                            or through the use of
                                            persistent memory, and some surprising theoretical results which are
                                            applicable to distributed
                                            data store systems that compromise consistency in favour of high
                                            availability and speed, but
                                            also support operations ensuring strong consistency (which requires
                                            consensus among replicas).

                                        <p>The performance of stream processing systems heavily relies on the ability to
                                            move data between
                                            stream processing operators efficiently. The softwarization of computer

                                            potential for distributed systems to accelerate the performance of

                                            operators by minimizing data movements and accelerating the execution of
                                            operators. Yet, using

                                            often conflict with the famous end-to-end principle. Therefore, in this
                                            talk, we will focus on
                                            abstractions that allow executing computations on heterogeneous resources of
                                            network elements
                                            and discuss how these abstractions can support stream processing systems. In
                                            particular, we
                                            highlight and introduce recent findings in distributed data stream
                                            processing, network function
                                            virtualization, and realtime packet streaming. We show how different
                                            paradigms and programming
                                            models support accelerating performance by better utilizing the capabilities
                                            of in-network
                                            computing elements. Moreover, we give an outlook on how future developments
                                            can change how
                                            distributed computing can be adaptively performed over networked

                                            infrastructure is
                                            geographically distributed, with multiple edge data centers in all
                                            continents. The Meta-verse
                                            stack consists of multiple layers of software systems, with complex
                                            dependencies that can be
                                            represented as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or a multi-layered queueing
                                            system. In short, the
                                            concept of Metastability happens when each moving part of the stack works in
                                            harmony. In
                                            contrast, a Metastable failure results from a trigger originating in some
                                            part of the stack that
                                            cascades through multiple dependencies to finally affect a third-party
                                            system. Such kind of
                                            failure has large-scale consequences and can deem the overall stack
                                            unusable. The present talk
                                            will deep-dive in the characterization (or absence) of metastability based

                                        <p>Data stream compression has attracted vast interest in emerging IoT (Internet
                                            of Things)
                                            applications. However, adopting stream compression on IoT applications is
                                            non-trivial due to the
                                            divergent demands, i.e., low energy consumption, high throughput, low
                                            latency, high
                                            compressibility, and tolerable information loss, which sometimes conflict
                                            with each other. This
                                            is particularly challenging when adopting stateful stream compression
                                            algorithms, which rely on
                                            <em>states</em>, e.g., a dictionary or model. This paper presents our vision

                                            hardware-conscious stateful stream compression framework for IoT
                                            applications. Through careful
                                            hardware-conscious optimizations, CStream will minimize energy consumption
                                            while striving to
                                            satisfy the divergent performance demands for parallelizing complex stateful

                                        <p>Sensory data profoundly influences the quality of detected events in a
                                            distributed complex event
                                            processing system (DCEP). Since each sensor's status is unstable at runtime,
                                            a single sensing
                                            assignment is often insufficient to fulfill the consumer's quality
                                            requirements. In this paper,
                                            we study in the context of AQuA-CEP the problem of dynamic quality
                                            monitoring and adaptation of

                                            support this, in
                                            AQuA-CEP, queries to detect complex events are supplemented with
                                            consumer-definable quality
                                            policies that are evaluated and used to autonomously select (or even
                                            configure) suitable data
                                            sources of the sensing infrastructure. In addition, we studied different
                                            forms of expressing
                                            quality policies and analyzed how it affects the quality monitoring process.
                                            Various modes of
                                            evaluating and applying quality-related adaptations and their impacts on
                                            correlation efficiency
                                            are addressed, too. We assessed the performance of AQuA-CEP in IoT scenarios
                                            by utilizing the
                                            notion of the quality policy alongside the query processing adaptation using
                                            knowledge derived
                                            from quality monitoring. The results show that AQuA-CEP can improve the
                                            performance of DCEP
                                            systems in terms of the quality of results while fulfilling the consumer's
                                            quality requirements.
                                            Quality-based adaptation can also increase the network's lifetime by
                                            optimizing the sensor's
                                            energy consumption due to efficient data source selection.</p>

                                        <p>This paper presents ComDeX, a context-aware federated architecture and IoT
                                            platform for enabling
                                            data exchange between IoT-enhanced communities. Today, such smart
                                            communities are highly
                                            heterogeneous and siloed as they can offer IoT applications and services
                                            only to their local
                                            community inhabitants. ComDeX uses property graphs to represent smart
                                            community entities and
                                            automatically maps them to context-aware publish/subscribe messages. Such
                                            messages can be
                                            discovered and exchanged between communities via a hierarchical federated
                                            topology and an
                                            advertisement-based mechanism. The ComDeX prototype is implemented using
                                            well-known IoT
                                            technologies such as MQTT and NGSI-LD. ComDeX is evaluated using a realistic
                                            smart port scenario
                                            and compared against different federation topologies. The experimental
                                            results demonstrate that
                                            our approach outperforms existing NGSI-LD solutions in realistic IoT
                                            scenarios with
                                            synthetically generated workloads, with low impact in larger deployments
                                            where the number of
                                            hops between brokers of the federation increases.</p>

                                            a prefix-alignment, which is used for pinpointing the exact deviations in

                                        <p>This paper introduces a new approximate algorithm - I Will Survive (IWS). The
                                            algorithm utilizes
                                            the trie data structure to improve the calculation speed, while remaining
                                            memory-efficient.
                                            Comparative analysis on real-life and synthetic datasets shows that the IWS
                                            algorithm can
                                            achieve an order of magnitude faster execution time while having a smaller
                                            error cost, compared
                                            to the current state of the art. In extreme cases, the IWS finds
                                            prefix-alignments roughly three
                                            orders of magnitude faster than previous approximate methods. The IWS
                                            algorithm includes a
                                            discounted decay time setting for more efficient memory usage and a
                                            look-ahead limit for
                                            improving computation time. Finally, the algorithm is stress tested for
                                            performance using a
                                            simulation of high-traffic event streams.</p>

                                        <p>Stream processing systems (SPSs) have been designed to process data streams
                                            in real-time,
                                            allowing organizations to analyze and act upon data on-the-fly, as it is
                                            generated. However,
                                            handling sensitive or personal data in these multilayered SPSs that
                                            distribute resources across
                                            sensor, fog, and cloud layers raises privacy concerns, as the data may be
                                            subject to
                                            unauthorized access and attacks that can violate user privacy, hence facing
                                            regulations such as
                                            the GDPR across the SPS layers. To address these issues, different
                                            privacy-preserving mechanisms
                                            (PPMs) are proposed to protect user privacy in SPSs. Yet, selecting and
                                            applying such PPMs in
                                            SPSs is challenging, since they must operate in real-time while tolerating
                                            little overhead. The
                                            multilayered nature of SPSs complicates privacy protection because each
                                            layer may confront
                                            different privacy threats, which must be addressed by specific PPMs. To
                                            overcome these
                                            challenges, we present Prinseps, our comprehensive privacy vision for SPSs.
                                            Towards this vision,
                                            we (1) identify critical privacy threats on different layers of the
                                            multilayered SPS, (2)
                                            evaluate the effectiveness of existing PPMs in addressing such threats, and
                                            (3) integrate
                                            privacy considerations into the decision-making processes of SPSs.</p>

                                            challenge when provisioning compute to meet the needs of these workloads.
                                            Rightsizing systems
                                            for peak demand leads to often-unacceptable financial cost, motivating the
                                            need for adaptive
                                            approaches to meet the needs of changing workloads. The choice of
                                            parallelism of workload
                                            operators are commonly governed by autoscalers, but their behaviour is often
                                            case specific and
                                            highly sensitive to the choice of tunable parameters and thresholds. This
                                            presents a challenge
                                            to practitioners wishing to understand the performance implications of their
                                            decisions.</p>
                                        <p>We systematically explore the impact of parameter tuning for a
                                            state-of-the-art autoscaler;

                                            phenomena such as extreme
                                            parallelism shifts and robustness. Autoscalers commonly make decisions on
                                            instantaneous system
                                            performance, without incorporating historical information. This seeks to
                                            mitigate challenges of
                                            being overly influenced by historical values, to be able to respond in

                                            system state. We demonstrate the potential to augment existing

                                            encryption techniques guarantee the security of the transactions (transfers

                                            undisputed. However, the relations between the trading prices across

                                            remains largely unexplored. Major coin exchanges indicate trend correlation
                                            to advise for sells
                                            or buys. However, price correlations remain largely unexplored. We shed some
                                            light on the trend
                                            correlations across a large variety of cryptocoins, by investigating their

                                            exploit the derived correlations to understand the accuracy of

                                        <p>Modern stream processing systems typically require ingesting and correlating
                                            data from multiple
                                            data sources. However, these sources are out of control and prone to
                                            software errors and
                                            unavailability, causing data anomalies that must be necessarily remedied
                                            before processing the
                                            data. In this context, anomaly, such as data duplication, appears as one of
                                            the most prominent
                                            challenges of stream processing. Data duplication can hinder real-time
                                            analysis of data for
                                            decision making. This paper investigates the challenges and performs an
                                            experimental analysis of
                                            operators and auxiliary tools to help with data deduplication. The results
                                            show that there is an
                                            increase in data delivery time when using external mechanisms. However,
                                            these mechanisms are
                                            essential for an ingestion process to guarantee that no data is lost and
                                            that no duplicates are

                                        <p>Virtual threads are a highly anticipated feature in the Java world, aiming at
                                            improving resource
                                            efficiency in the JVM for I/O intensive operations while simplifying
                                            developer experience. This
                                            feature keeps the traditional thread abstraction and makes it compatible
                                            with most of the
                                            existing Java applications, allowing developers preferring synchronous
                                            imperative abstractions
                                            to benefit from better performance without switching to asynchronous and
                                            reactive programming
                                            models. However, limitations currently hinder the usability of virtual
                                            threads. These
                                            limitations must be considered when building a piece of software around
                                            virtual threads for they
                                            might have non-trivial effects. This paper (i) discusses the different
                                            strategies envisioned to
                                            leverage virtual threads in the <em>Quarkus</em> framework, (ii) gives an
                                            overview of the final
                                            implementation, (iii) presents the benchmark used to characterize the
                                            benefits of using virtual
                                            threads in a typical container environment where resources are scarce
                                            compared to using Quarkus
                                            with traditional thread pools and Quarkus with reactive libraries ; (iv)

                                            and discussed. Our study reveals that the integration of virtual threads in
                                            Quarkus doesn't
                                            perform as well as Quarkus-reactive. This seems to be due to a mismatch
                                            between the core

                                            quotes. Our solution
                                            extends a first system we developed for this problem that used sequential

                                            to correctly preserve the per symbol ordering while placing them to their

                                            window. The solution described in this paper allows for parallel ingestion

                                            to increase throughput, while ensuring order via a broadcast mechanism that
                                            propagates necessary
                                            ordering metadata to downstream operators. Evaluation of our prototype on a

                                        <p>It is difficult to accurately predict application run times in high
                                            performance computing (HPC),
                                            yet these predictions have useful applications in job scheduling and user
                                            feedback. User-led
                                            predictions can be inaccurate for a variety of factors, including
                                            inexperience, user burden, and
                                            an incentive to overpredict. Most automated efforts consider standardized
                                            job inputs from
                                            submission scripts but ignore application input parameters. Application
                                            input parameters can
                                            greatly enhance run time prediction accuracy but have typically been avoided
                                            due to the need for
                                            manual, per-application parameter collection.</p>
                                        <p>In this paper, we evaluate and compare the trade-offs between conventional,
                                            job script-based
                                            predictors and specialized, application input-based predictors. This is
                                            accomplished by testing
                                            20 machine learning model variants and four traditional predictors against a
                                            suite of five
                                            applications. This suite includes four commonly used and representative
                                            proxy applications and
                                            one real-world application. For reproducibility and extensibility, we
                                            provide the source code of
                                            our testing framework and our data set, which, to the best of our knowledge,
                                            is the first known
                                            publicized data set to include application input parameters alongside
                                            standard job parameters.
                                            We determine that the random forest regressor offers the best trade-off
                                            between accuracy and
                                            training time among all tested model variants. We show that job parameters
                                            alone are
                                            insufficient to produce adequate predictions while application input
                                            parameters provide
                                            excellent results, as high as 99% <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>, and typically
                                            outperform the use of
                                            job parameters alone.</p>

                                        <p>We present FORTE, an extensible framework for robustness and

                                            pipelines. We identify sources of potential bottlenecks and explore the

                                            approaches to deal with the challenges they pose. We study and evaluate

                                        <p>All in all, FORTE enables to deal with trade-offs and achieve benefits in

                                        <p>In ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things, devices monitor the

                                            data to applications that assist people or export results for other
                                            services. Given the
                                            distributed nature of such systems, message-based systems are often used due
                                            to their high
                                            degree of decoupling and flexibility. A major problem for developers of such

                                            applications is that the characteristics of the deployment scenario are
                                            often not fully known at
                                            design time or can change unpredictively at run time. A middleware with

                                            abstractions can fill this gap hiding complexity and uncertainty from the
                                            application developer.
                                            For example, the dynamic set programming abstraction decreases the amount of
                                            information needed
                                            by an application developer at design time by allowing applications to
                                            interact with multiple
                                            remote devices as if there was only a single device.</p>
                                        <p>This paper deals with platform and protocol-independent abstractions for
                                            remote object binding,
                                            pull and push-based interactions as well as the adaptive switch between push
                                            and pull to
                                            optimize communication. We present a mapping of interaction patterns to an
                                            expandable addressing
                                            scheme based on topic-based publish/subscribe communication. Abstractions to
                                            cope with the fact
                                            that transport protocols are often not known at design time are also
                                            discussed. MQTT and AMQP
                                            serve as examples for protocols with different message structures. In
                                            addition, the structuring
                                            of the associated serialization through JavaScript object notation (JSON)

                                        <p>Distributed systems, potentially growing large and consisting of
                                            heterogeneous nodes, are advised
                                            to be constructed following the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking paradigm. It
                                            becomes imperative
                                            that a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is paired with efficient protocols for
                                            each phase of its life
                                            cycle: construction as well as maintenance and operation. Three operations
                                            are fundamental for a
                                            Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network: nodes must be able to <em>a)</em> join,
                                            <em>b)</em> be located,
                                            <em>c)</em> leave. The main challenge for efficient protocols is that a
                                            single node will only
                                            possess limited information about the network, also known as the local view.
                                            In this paper, we
                                            present the minimal height tree overlay network (MINHTON), a Peer-to-Peer
                                            (P2P) overlay
                                            architecture featuring several beneficial structural properties added over
                                            existing
                                            tree-structured networks. The minimal height guarantees a global tree
                                            balance, yet, it must be
                                            retained at all times, even though the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network may change
                                            dynamically.
                                            MINHTON provides efficient protocols for node <em>Join</em> and
                                            <em>Departure</em>, both
                                            retaining a minimal height tree. We show that the operations achieve
                                            performance in logarithmic
                                            order, comparable to tree overlays with less strict structural guarantees.

                                            by supporting the
                                            flexible integration of multiple obfuscation techniques and studying
                                            deployment strategies for
                                            privacy-enforcing mechanisms. In addition, we share ideas on <em>how</em> to
                                            model the
                                            adversary's knowledge to select appropriate obfuscation techniques for the
                                            discussed deployment
                                            strategies. Initial results indicate that flexibly choosing obfuscation
                                            techniques and
                                            deployment strategies is essential to conceal privacy-sensitive event
                                            patterns accurately.</p>

                                        <p>The rapidly expanding field of Internet of Things (IoT) has necessitated the
                                            development of
                                            effective and efficient systems for handling the vast quantities of data
                                            that are generated.
                                            However, the inherent diversity and complexity of IoT environments, coupled
                                            with the large
                                            volume of data, pose significant challenges to achieving interoperability
                                            and efficient data
                                            exchange. ComDeX [3], is a novel approach designed to meet these challenges.
                                            This demo paper
                                            presents the prototype of ComDeX, which is designed to facilitate efficient
                                            data exchange in
                                            smart communities using a federation of message brokers. The prototype
                                            harnesses NGSI-LD and
                                            MQTT standards along with an advertisement-based mechanism to enable dynamic
                                            data exchange. We
                                            detail its implementation and key functionalities, demonstrating its
                                            applicability through
                                            scenarios that mimic real-world smart communities.</p>

                                        <p>Stream processing is becoming increasingly important as the amount of data
                                            being produced,
                                            transmitted, processed, and stored continues to grow. One of the greatest
                                            difficulties in
                                            designing stream processing applications is estimating the final runtime
                                            performance in
                                            production. This is often complicated by differences between the development
                                            and final execution
                                            environments, unexpected outliers in the incoming data, or subtle long-term

                                            instruments have profoundly changed the way of implementing and deploying
                                            systems in industrial
                                            and home environments, for diverse scenarios such as smart agriculture,
                                            healthcare, or
                                            manufacturing. Devices in these settings are not limited to simply observe
                                            and acquire data for
                                            monitoring, but they are also equipped with actuation capabilities, as well
                                            as the possibility
                                            of autonomously processing the incoming data through various techniques.
                                            However, given their
                                            intrinsic limitations regarding the capacity to store and process
                                            computations, it is often
                                            necessary to delegate some of these processing tasks to intermediary edge
                                            nodes in the network.
                                            These nodes, given their unique position can act as orchestrators guiding
                                            the decentralized work
                                            of the interconnected autonomous devices. Beyond static and pre-defined
                                            organization structures,
                                            in this work we propose the usage of agent and multi-agent-based models for
                                            designing and
                                            implementing swarms of edge nodes, conceived to dynamically orchestrate
                                            other devices, while
                                            meeting quality of service conditions. Allowing the control of intelligent
                                            edge nodes as
                                            conveyors and orchestrators on swarms of devices, we aim at providing
                                            intelligence to the
                                            self-organization of edge nodes, which may interchange streaming data, and
                                            represent their own
                                            capabilities through semantic models. Swarm-inspired behavioral patterns
                                            would guide the
                                            collaborative distribution of their computational tasks. Finally, we will

                                        <p>This PhD project proposes the theoretical and technological foundations of an
                                            approach for
                                            decentralized processing of streaming knowledge graphs, where autonomous
                                            reasoners may combine
                                            individual and collective processing of continuous data. These decentralized
                                            stream processors
                                            shall be capable of sharing not only data stream knowledge, but also
                                            processing duties, using
                                            collaboration and negotiation protocols. Moreover, commonly agreed semantic
                                            vocabularies will be
                                            used to address the high dynamicity of reasoners' knowledge and goals. The
                                            approach proposed in
                                            this project goes beyond previous works on stream reasoning, enabling the
                                            self-organization and
                                            coordination among distributed stream reasoners, based on techniques and
                                            principles inspired by
                                            Multi-Agent systems. On the one hand, it adds the ability to explicate
                                            processing goals,
                                            capabilities and knowledge, while on the other it exploits potential ways of
                                            interconnecting
                                            them in ways that expand their combined capacity/efficacy for managing
                                            highly dynamic flows of
                                            streaming knowledge. Through this approach, efficient local stream
                                            processors can establish
                                            cooperative processing schemes, respecting data privacy restrictions and
                                            data locality
                                            requirements through the exchange of streaming Knowledge Graphs.</p>

                                        <p>Sensor data often contain private information that requires proper
                                            protection. Most existing
                                            privacy-preserving mechanisms (PPMs) for data streams undermine the utility
                                            of the entire data
                                            stream and limit the performance of data-driven applications. We attempt to
                                            break the limitation
                                            and establish a new foundation for PPMs by proposing novel pattern-level
                                            differential privacy
                                            (DP) guarantees and pattern-level PPMs that fulfill pattern-level DP. They
                                            operate only on data
                                            that correlate with private patterns rather than on the entire data stream,
                                            leading to higher
                                            data utility. We first describe results for sequence operator based patterns
                                            in a centralized
                                            system and outline future work to generalize it for other operators and to
                                            local solutions.</p>
